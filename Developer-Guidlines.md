# Respect and openness: 
 
- Adopt a mutually respectful social structure, acknowledging that every developer, whatever their expertise or experience, adds unique ideas and viewpoints to the development effort. 
- Create a friendly and accepting workplace in which everybody involved feel respected, included, and motivated to engage. 

  
# Communication that works: 

- In all project conversations, whether through talks, issue comments, or pull requests, aim for unambiguous and straightforward communicating. 
- Participate in proactive discussions, ask inquiries that clarify as needed, and make an attempt to explain your thoughts and concepts effectively and simply. 

  
# Criticism that is constructive: 

- When giving suggestions for code or project choices, focus on constructive criticism aimed at enhancing the project's quality and functionality. 
- Promote open and healthy debates that result in mutually beneficial solutions and improvements. 

# Dispute Resolution: 

- Acknowledge that conflicts and dissatisfaction may happen during the collaborative process. Handle these disagreements in an appropriate, respectful, and solution-focused approach. 
- Engage project developers or request negotiation if issues increase or persist in order to find acceptable alternatives. 

# Community Development: 

- Collaborate actively in efforts to create communities through contributing expertise, aiding other developers, and attending community gatherings. 
- Contributing to the project's community's expansion and liveliness by improving its shared expertise and fellowship. 

# Practices for Version Control: 

  

# Messages of Commitment: 

- Create useful and informative commit comments that accurately express the purpose and extent of the modifications that were committed. 
- To promote extensive documentation, make it a habit to cite relevant issues or pull requests in commit messages where possible. 

# Versioning: 

- Ensure stability in version numbering and releases by adhering to the project's chosen versioning strategy. 
- Ensure that any modifications to the coding are appropriately and completely taken into account in version updates. 

# Hygiene in the Branch: 

- Follow the defined branching strategy for the project. Use branch names which are clear and descriptive of the feature or issue being handled. 
- Avoid pushing directly to main branches; instead, create feature-specific branches for exploration and testing.
