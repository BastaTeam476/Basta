- Participate in proactive discussions, ask inquiries that clarify as needed, and make an attempt to explain your thoughts and concepts effectively and simply. 

  
# Criticism that is constructive: 

- When giving suggestions for code or project choices, focus on constructive criticism aimed at enhancing the project's quality and functionality. 
- Promote open and healthy debates that result in mutually beneficial solutions and improvements. 

# Dispute Resolution: 

- Acknowledge that conflicts and dissatisfaction may happen during the collaborative process. Handle these disagreements in an appropriate, respectful, and solution-focused approach. 
- Engage project developers or request negotiation if issues increase or persist in order to find acceptable alternatives. 

# Community Development: 

- Collaborate actively in efforts to create communities through contributing expertise, aiding other developers, and attending community gatherings. 
- Contributing to the project's community's expansion and liveliness by improving its shared expertise and fellowship. 

# Practices for Version Control: 

  

# Messages of Commitment: 

- Create useful and informative commit comments that accurately express the purpose and extent of the modifications that were committed. 
- To promote extensive documentation, make it a habit to cite relevant issues or pull requests in commit messages where possible. 

# Versioning: 

- Ensure stability in version numbering and releases by adhering to the project's chosen versioning strategy. 
- Ensure that any modifications to the coding are appropriately and completely taken into account in version updates. 

# Hygiene in the Branch: 

- Follow the defined branching strategy for the project. Use branch names which are clear and descriptive of the feature or issue being handled. 
- Avoid pushing directly to main branches; instead, create feature-specific branches for exploration and testing.

# Compliance with licenses: 

# License Knowledge: 

- Develop an awareness of the project's licensing conditions as well as the repercussions of using, modifying, and making contributions to the codebase. 
- If problems or uncertainties develop regarding license issues, seek clarification and adherence from project administrators or legal professionals. 

# Copyright and attribution: 

- Acknowledge and adhere to proper crediting and copyright disclosures for any outside code or material used in the project. 
- Ensure that all efforts meet the project's license conditions as well as standard procedures for copyright adherence. 

# Dependencies on Third Parties: 

- Keep a complete and well-documented record of all third-party components used in the development process. It involves specifics about licenses, versions, and any changes that have been made. 
- Assure that any modifications or contributions do not violate these dependencies' licenses, encouraging complete adherence and transparent administration. 
- Comments about the code, documentation, and coding standards: 

# Transparency in Comment: 

- Encourage the addition of clear, succinct, and helpful comments across the codebase, especially in sections with complex logic, algorithms, or unusual conclusions. 
- Utilize inline comments sparingly, concentrating on code portions that truly demand explanation or context. 

# Documentation: 

- Keep and enhance detailed documentation that covers all areas of the project. Installation instructions, API usage recommendations, and specific to the project material are all included. 
- Maintain up-to-date records, guaranteeing that it appropriately describes the current situation with the code and is in sync with project progress. 

# Coding Requirements: 

- Develop and follow coding standards and norms throughout the project. 
- Set the use of tabs or spaces, the degree of indentation, and the line width limit. 
- In order to ensure consistency and accuracy, emphasize the necessity of sticking to coding principles. 

# Coding Techniques: 

# Standards for Naming: 

- Create and follow distinct naming patterns for variables, functions, classes, and other code objects. 
- Give samples and recommendations to demonstrate the desired naming fashion, promoting consistency across the codebase. 

# Handling Errors: 

- Establish principles for error handling inside the codebase. 
- Define when exceptions, error codes, or other error-handling strategies should be used, with an emphasis on solid and resilient code. 

# Dependencies: 

- Keep a detailed record of all third-party dependencies utilized in the project, including their licenses and versions. 
- Any unique dependencies that are crucial to the project's functionality should be clearly documented. 

# Testing: 

- Promote an environment of accurate testing throughout the development procedure, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. 
- Describe the testing frameworks, tools, and practices that will be used to conduct tests. 
- To assure the project's safety and quality, advocate for periodic testing as an inherent element of production.
