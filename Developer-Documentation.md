# Developer Documentation
The developer documentation that is written by the programmers provides essential information for other programmers interested in contributing to the open-source project to understand the code so they can extend it, and fix any issues easily. Developer documentation includes step-by-step instructions on setting up the development environment, guidelines for coding standards and best practices, and details on how to submit bug reports and pull requests. The documentation aims to make it easy for developers to understand the project's architecture, contribute effectively, and collaborate with the project team. For this primary documentation, we will use wikis, so the documentation will be organized.
