# Choose a Good Name
Coming up with a good name for an open-source software project can be challenging, but it is an important decision that significantly reflects the project's level of professionalism, functionality, and overall appeal. 
<br>
<br> Several considerations guided our process of naming the project: 
<br>
1- Reflecting Purpose: the project name needs to reflect on what the project does and gives some idea about the project. Therefore, we aimed to select a name that directly relates to what the project does to ensure that users can readily identify its primary focus.
<br>
2-	Easy to Remember: recognizing the importance of simplicity and memorability, we prioritized a name that users can effortlessly recall.
<br>
3-	Uniqueness Matters: to prevent confusion and potential conflicts, we avoided overly generic or similar names to existing projects. Our search extended to GitHub looking for projects with similar names to avoid trademark infringement and conflicts.
<br>
4-	Check Domain Availability: considering the significance of an online presence, we examined the availability of matching domain names with a .com extension. Securing a domain aligns with advertising the official home site and enhancing the project's visibility on the internet.
